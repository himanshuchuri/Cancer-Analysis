# About:
  Since the past couple of months, I have neen hearing a lot of cancer bein diagnosed among celebrities as well as from my mother who is a medical practitioner, and most of the people who have been diagnesed are relatively in their 30's and 40's (young adults). According to the the National Cancer Institute (NCI) the median age for cancer disgnostics is 66 (https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/age#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20the%20median%20age,be%20diagnosed%20at%20any%20age).

  There could be Two posible explainations for this:

  1. Earlier diagnoses due to increased public awareness and improved screening techniques could be creating the impression of a rise in cases.
  2. There's ongoing research into a potential rise in early-onset cancers (https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/09/researchers-report-dramatic-rise-in-early-onset-cancers/). Factors like lifestyle changes, environmental exposures, or even unidentified factors could be at play.
  3. Its just a confirmation bias.

  In order to confirm this here is a visualization of the cancer data.

## Details:
  The overall objective of the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) series is to make available comparable data on cancer incidence from as wide a range of geographical locations worldwide as possible. Traditionally, this has been through publication of a volume containing tabulations of cancer incidence rates at approximately five year intervals. The volumes contain three basic elements:
   * tabulations from individual registries presenting incidence rates according to sex, age group, and cancer site;
   * summary tables permitting comparisons between registries;
   * tables presenting indices of the validity and completeness of the different contributions. Each volume has seen substantial innovation with a view to providing more information while preserving the basic core data and layout. The cancer registries that have provided the data are members of the International Association of Cancer Registries.
     
The material accessible through this application contains the basic data published in the 12 volumes of CI5.

This project uses the latest (as of March 23 2024) the latest Ci5 dataset - CI5-XII
